                    "translation": "Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.",
                    "commentary": "This verse establishes the fundamental Buddhist principle that the mind is the forerunner of all mental phenomena. All our experiences, whether pleasant or unpleasant, originate from the mind. When we act or speak with a corrupted mind filled with greed, hatred, or delusion, suffering inevitably follows us, just as the wheel of a cart follows the hoof of the ox pulling it. The simile emphasizes the inescapable nature of this cause-and-effect relationship.",

                        "content": "Cakkhupāla was a monk who became blind while meditating. Some monks accused him of killing insects, but the Buddha defended him, explaining that Cakkhupāla had attained Arahantship and could not intentionally harm any living being. The Buddha then revealed that in a past life, Cakkhupāla had been a physician who intentionally blinded a woman. That unwholesome action resulted in his blindness in this life, demonstrating how suffering follows evil actions. However, through his pure practice in this life, he attained liberation, showing that present wholesome actions lead to freedom from suffering."

When our mind is pure, filled with loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom, happiness naturally follows all our actions. Just as a shadow never leaves its object when the sun shines, happiness accompanies those who cultivate wholesome mental states. Together, these first two verses underscore the profound impact of mental purity on one's well-being and emphasize the importance of cultivating a pure mind.",

When he fell ill and was dying, his father wouldn't even call a physician. The Buddha, seeing the boy's potential, visited him. Upon seeing the Buddha, Maṭṭakuṇḍali developed a pure, joyful mind filled with faith. He died with this wholesome mental state and was reborn in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven. This story illustrates how even a brief moment of pure mind at the time of death can lead to a fortunate rebirth and happiness."

When we constantly replay past wrongs in our minds, dwelling on how we were abused, struck, defeated, or robbed, we keep our hatred alive and prevent it from subsiding. The act of harboring such thoughts perpetuates animosity and prevents inner peace. This verse teaches that the problem is not just the original wrong, but our continued mental engagement with it.",

His mind became disturbed, and he could not progress in his meditation. The Buddha, knowing his mental state, taught him these verses about letting go of grudges. Upon hearing the teaching, Tissa realized the futility of holding onto resentment. He immediately let go of his anger and, with a peaceful mind, soon attained Arahantship."

                    "commentary": "This verse provides the solution to the problem presented in verse 3. By choosing not to dwell on past wrongs, by consciously deciding not to harbor thoughts of resentment, we allow our hatred to naturally subside and cease. Peace comes from our own decision to release resentment and forgive. This is not about condoning wrongdoing, but about freeing ourselves from the mental burden of hatred. The verse emphasizes that we have control over our mental states and can choose peace over perpetual anger.",

The Buddha tried to reconcile them, but they were too attached to their positions. Eventually, the Buddha left them and spent the rains retreat alone in the forest. The lay supporters, disappointed by the monks' behavior, stopped supporting them. Humbled and realizing their mistake, the monks let go of their grudges and reconciled. Once they stopped harboring thoughts of past wrongs, harmony was immediately restored, demonstrating the power of letting go."

                    "commentary": "This is one of the most famous and profound verses in the Dhammapada. It proclaims the timeless truth that responding to hatred with more hatred only perpetuates the cycle of conflict and suffering. Only through the absence of hatred—through love, compassion, and forgiveness—can animosity truly end. This eternal law (sanantano dhammo) applies universally, across all times and places. It is a fundamental principle of Buddhist ethics and a practical guide for resolving conflicts at all levels, from personal relationships to international disputes.",

Their son, Prince Dīghāvu, was born in hiding. When Dīghāvu was a young man, King Brahmadatta captured and executed King Dīghīti. Before his death, Dīghīti whispered to his son: 'Do not look long, do not look short'—meaning do not perpetuate hatred or be hasty in revenge. Later, Dīghāvu had the opportunity to kill King Brahmadatta but chose not to, remembering his father's words. When he revealed his identity and his father's final teaching, King Brahmadatta was deeply moved. He restored Dīghāvu's kingdom and the two became friends. The Buddha used this story to illustrate that hatred can only be overcome by non-hatred."

                    "commentary": "This verse points out that many quarrels and conflicts arise from ignorance of our mortality and the impermanent nature of existence. People who do not understand that life is fleeting and that death comes to all engage in petty disputes and harbor grudges. However, those who truly comprehend the reality of death and impermanence see the futility of such conflicts. This understanding of our shared mortality brings perspective and wisdom, leading to the cessation of quarrels. The wise (medhagā) who realize this truth naturally let go of their disputes and live in peace.",

They acted as if they would live forever and as if their disagreement was of ultimate importance. The Buddha reminded them of the impermanence of life and the certainty of death. When the monks reflected on this teaching and realized that they were wasting their precious human life on petty conflicts, they were filled with remorse. Understanding that death could come at any moment and that their time for practice was limited, they immediately settled their quarrel and returned to harmonious living and diligent practice."

                    "commentary": "This verse describes the vulnerability of those who live heedlessly. Mara (representing temptation, defilements, and death) easily overcomes those who: (1) contemplate only pleasant things and seek sensual pleasures, (2) have unguarded sense faculties, allowing unwholesome impressions to enter freely, (3) are immoderate in eating, lacking restraint in consumption, (4) are lazy and lacking in energy for spiritual practice. Such a person is compared to a weak tree that is easily uprooted by a storm. Without the strength of virtue, mindfulness, and effort, one is defenseless against the forces of defilement.",

Though he had faith in the Buddha, he lacked the discipline to follow the path seriously. One day, he fell seriously ill. On his deathbed, he saw a vision of hell and became terrified. He called for the Buddha, who came and taught him to focus his mind on wholesome thoughts. With great effort, Mahākāla managed to purify his mind before death and avoided an unfortunate rebirth. The Buddha used this example to teach that those who live heedlessly are like weak trees, easily overcome by Mara, and must exert great effort to avoid suffering."

                    "commentary": "This verse presents the opposite of verse 7, describing the strength of those who practice diligently. Mara cannot overcome those who: (1) contemplate impurities (asubha) to counter attachment to the body and sensual pleasures, (2) guard their sense faculties with mindfulness, (3) practice moderation in eating, (4) possess faith (saddhā) in the Triple Gem, and (5) arouse sustained energy (viriya) for practice. Such a person is compared to a solid rocky mountain that remains unmoved by storms. This verse emphasizes that spiritual strength comes from disciplined practice and mental cultivation.",

He meditated on the impurities of the body, guarded his senses carefully, ate moderately, and maintained strong faith and energy. Though Mara tried many times to distract him with sensual temptations and doubts, Cūḷakāla remained unmoved, like a mountain in a storm. Through his steadfast practice, he attained Arahantship. The Buddha praised him as an example of one who, through discipline and effort, becomes invincible to Mara's attacks. The contrast between the two brothers illustrates the different outcomes of heedless versus diligent living."

The yellow or saffron robe (kāsāva) is the traditional garment of Buddhist monks, symbolizing renunciation and purity. However, merely wearing the robe does not make one a true renunciant. If a person is still stained with defilements (anikkasāvo), lacks self-control (dama), and is not truthful (sacca), they are not worthy of wearing the robe, regardless of their outward appearance. True monasticism requires inner transformation, not just external conformity.",

Though he wore the yellow robe, he was filled with evil intentions. He tried to kill the Buddha, created a schism in the Sangha, and committed other grave offenses. Despite his monastic appearance, Devadatta was not worthy of the robe because he lacked self-control, truthfulness, and moral integrity. Eventually, his evil actions led to his downfall—he was swallowed by the earth and reborn in hell. The Buddha used Devadatta as an example of one who wears the robe but is unworthy of it due to inner corruption."

Such a person has: (1) purged all defilements and moral stains (vantakasāva), (2) become well-established in virtuous conduct (sīlesu susamāhito), (3) developed self-control over body, speech, and mind (dama), and (4) cultivated truthfulness and integrity (sacca). When these inner qualities are present, the wearing of the yellow robe is appropriate and meaningful.

Before ordaining, he was already seeking truth earnestly. After hearing just one verse of the Dhamma, he attained the first stage of enlightenment. As a monk, he was renowned for his virtue, wisdom, self-control, and absolute truthfulness. He never spoke a false word, even in jest. His mind was completely purged of defilements, and he was perfectly established in ethical conduct. The Buddha often praised Sāriputta as one who was truly worthy of the yellow robe, embodying all the qualities of a genuine renunciant. His life demonstrated that the robe's true value lies in the purity of the wearer."

Many people mistake the unessential (asāra)—such as wealth, status, sensual pleasures, and material possessions—for what is essential (sāra). Conversely, they regard the essential—such as virtue, wisdom, mental purification, and liberation—as unessential or unimportant.

They considered these worldly topics interesting and important, while viewing meditation and study of the teachings as boring and unimportant. They wore the robes and lived in the monastery but never engaged seriously with the practice. Years passed, and they made no spiritual progress. When the Buddha learned of this, he admonished them with this verse, explaining that they had mistaken the unessential for the essential. Some of the monks, upon hearing this teaching, recognized their error and changed their ways, eventually making progress on the path. Others continued in their delusion and never attained the essential."

His passion for her was so strong that he could not concentrate on his practice. The Buddha, understanding his condition, used skillful means to help him. He took Nanda to the heavenly realms and showed him celestial nymphs far more beautiful than his wife, promising these as a reward for practice. This motivated Nanda to develop his mind through meditation.

He practiced mindfulness of the body, contemplation of impurity, and other meditation subjects that countered sensual desire. As his concentration deepened and his wisdom grew, his mind became like a well-thatched house. The passion that had previously tormented him could no longer penetrate his consciousness. Even when he recalled his beautiful wife or thought of the celestial nymphs, his well-developed mind remained unmoved. Eventually, he realized that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. With this insight, he attained Arahantship, and his mind became completely liberated from all forms of passion. The Buddha used Nanda's transformation as an example of how a well-developed mind becomes invincible."

The Buddha confirmed that even celestial beings honor such accomplished Arahants."

So he ran away and went to a monastery where he was made a samanera. He took a meditation subject and left for an acacia forest thirty yojanas away. At the end of the vassa, he attained arahatship. The Buddha accompanied by Thera Sariputta and five hundred other bhikkhus set out to visit him. The journey was long and rough, but the devas looked to all their needs. Revata created special monasteries by supernormal power. On their return, they came to Visakha's house, who offered them alms-food. After the meal, Visakha asked the Buddha if the place of Revata in the acacia forest was pleasant.

However, those who are free from passion (vītarāga) - the Arahants - delight in such secluded places precisely because they are conducive to meditation and peace. Arahants do not seek sensual pleasures (kāma), so the absence of worldly attractions is no disadvantage to them.

He thought, 'I have done many evil deeds, I should make merit by offering rice gruel to this monk.' He invited the elder, offered the gruel, and stood fanning him. Seeing that the man was famished, the elder told him to eat and called someone else to fan him. Then he taught him the Dhamma. Unable to concentrate due to remorse, the executioner was troubled. The elder skillfully questioned him about whether he had wished to kill all those people, or whether another had made him do it. He replied that the king made him do it. The elder asked, 'In that case, what evil have you done?' This relieved his guilt enough for him to concentrate on the Dhamma talk. He gained a high stage of insight knowledge and died that same day, being reborn in the Tuṣita heaven. The Buddha explained that his fortunate rebirth was due to the excellent, beneficial advice of the Elder Sāriputta - one meaningful teaching that brought him peace."

The locals thought he was an Arahant, and because of their adulation, he came to believe it himself. In a former life, Bāhiya had been one of seven monks who isolated themselves on a mountain ledge attempting to attain the goal. The eldest attained Arahantship and the second attained Non-returning, but Bāhiya and four others died in the attempt. The second monk, reborn in the Brahma realm, saw Bāhiya's plight and came to advise him that he was not an Arahant. He told him the true Arahant, the Buddha, was dwelling at Sāvatthī. At once, Bāhiya set off and with celestial help arrived the next morning while the Buddha was on his alms-round. Bāhiya repeatedly requested the Dhamma teaching. Seeing that his mind was now equanimous, the Buddha taught him: 'Bāhiya, train yourself like this — when you see something, just know that you see it; when you hear something, just know that you hear it. When, Bāhiya, for you in the seen is merely what is seen, in the known is merely the known, then you will not be with that. When you are not with that, then you will not be in that. When you are not in that, then you will be neither here, nor beyond, nor in between. Just this is the end of suffering.' As the Buddha was teaching this brief Dhamma, the mind of Bāhiya was freed from all defilements. Shortly afterwards, Bāhiya was gored to death by a cow. The Buddha told the monks to cremate his body and build a stūpa as Bāhiya had attained Arahantship through just a few meaningful verses."

External rituals, however ancient or elaborate, cannot compete with honoring one who has achieved internal purification. This was a radical teaching that challenged the prevailing religious orthodoxy of fire-sacrifice and ritual worship.",

Every month, he would sacrifice an animal to tend the sacrificial fire, believing this would lead to rebirth in the Brahma realm. He devoted enormous effort to maintaining the sacred fire and performing the prescribed rituals exactly as taught by his teachers. The Elder Sāriputta, concerned for his nephew's spiritual welfare, went to visit him. He gently explained that neither his nephew nor his teachers actually possessed direct knowledge of the path to the Brahma realm. Their practices were based on tradition and belief, not on personal realization. The Elder took his nephew to meet the Buddha, who taught him that a century spent tending the sacred fire could not equal a moment spent honoring someone who had truly perfected themselves through the Buddha's teaching. The Buddha explained that external fire-rituals, while they might generate some merit, could never match the merit of honoring one who had extinguished the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion within themselves. The nephew, deeply moved by this teaching and recognizing its profound truth, abandoned his fire-sacrifices and became a devoted follower of the Buddha, seeking to purify his own mind rather than tending external fires."

Every year, he would organize a grand sacrificial ceremony, slaughtering many animals and distributing gifts to Brahmins, believing this would generate great merit and secure a favorable rebirth. He spent enormous sums on these annual festivals and took great pride in their scale and magnificence. The Elder Sāriputta, remembering their friendship and concerned for his friend's spiritual welfare, decided to visit him. He found his friend busily preparing for yet another grand sacrifice. The Elder gently suggested that there might be a better way to generate merit. His friend was skeptical - how could anything surpass the merit of his grand annual sacrifices? The Elder took him to meet the Buddha. The Buddha taught him that all his year-long offerings and sacrifices did not equal even one-fourth of the merit gained from showing genuine reverence to those who had perfected themselves in virtue and wisdom. The Buddha explained that while material offerings had their place, they paled in comparison to the spiritual benefit of honoring and learning from the truly virtuous. The friend, deeply impressed by the Buddha's wisdom and recognizing the superficiality of his ritualistic approach, became a devoted follower. He redirected his resources from animal sacrifices to supporting the Sangha and, more importantly, devoted himself to cultivating virtue and wisdom in his own life."

After forty-eight years of practice together, one returned to household life, married, and started a family. When his son was born, he visited his former companion to pay respects and receive a blessing. The ascetic blessed him and his wife with the words 'Long-life to you,' but he did not bless the newborn son. When asked why, the ascetic said that the boy would die within seven days, but suggested that the recluse Gotama might know how to prevent it. The anxious father took his son to the Buddha, who could see the child's past kamma that would lead to his death. However, the Buddha, in his compassion, devised a plan. He instructed the father to erect a pavilion at the door of his house and invite the monks to recite the Protection Discourses continuously for seven days and nights. During this time, the father and his family showed utmost respect and reverence to the monks, serving them with devotion. On the seventh day, the Buddha himself came to recite the texts. On the morning of the eighth day, the danger had passed. The Buddha blessed the child with long life, saying he would live for one hundred and twenty years, and the boy was named Āyuvaḍḍhana - 'increase of life.' When the monks discussed how the child gained long life through the Buddha's compassion, the Buddha spoke this verse, explaining that it was actually the family's respectful service and honoring of the virtuous monks that generated the merit to overcome the child's negative kamma. The four blessings of long life, beauty, happiness, and strength naturally increased for those who constantly honored the worthy with sincerity."

A band of thieves, learning of the monks' presence in the forest, approached them and demanded that a monk be given as a human sacrifice to their deity. All the elder monks volunteered to offer their lives, but Saṁkicca, though just a novice, obtained their permission to sacrifice his life for the sake of the others, explaining this was why the Buddha had sent him. The bandits took him to their lair and prepared to kill him. The novice entered jhāna, and his mind became so powerful and peaceful that when the ringleader tried to execute him with his sword, it bounced off his neck. He tried again, but his sword shattered. Terrified and amazed, the bandit prostrated himself, begged forgiveness, listened to the Dhamma, and asked to become a monk. All the bandits followed suit. The novice gave them the going-forth and returned to inform the other monks, who were still meditating peacefully in the forest. He took his disciples to the Buddha and related what had happened. The Buddha spoke this verse, explaining that though the young novice had lived only a short time, his life of virtue and meditation was worth more than a hundred years lived immorally and without control.

Tired from his journey, he sat on a flat rock to rest and entered jhāna meditation. That night, a large group of thieves who had plundered a village came to the same spot carrying their stolen goods. In the darkness, they mistook the meditating elder for a tree stump and piled all their loot over his head before lying down to sleep. At dawn, when they awoke and saw it was actually a monk sitting in meditation, they were terrified, thinking he might be a non-human spirit or deity. The elder calmly told them not to be alarmed and explained that he was merely a monk practicing meditation. The thieves were astounded by his composure and unshakeable peace. They fell at his feet asking forgiveness for their disrespect. The elder taught them the Dhamma, and they were so moved by his wisdom and the peace evident in his meditation that they asked him to give them ordination. He ordained all of them on the spot and brought them to the Buddha. When the monks heard this story, they marveled at how these thieves, who had lived many years in wickedness, were transformed in a single encounter with a wise and meditative monk. The Buddha spoke this verse to explain that the elder's one day of life - lived with wisdom and meditation so profound that he remained unmoved even when thieves piled stolen goods on his head - was worth more than a hundred years lived foolishly and without mental cultivation. This is why he became known as Tree-stump Koṇḍañña, and his single day of wisdom and meditation had transformed an entire band of criminals into monks on the path to liberation."

Despair overcame him, and he wanted to end his life. One day, when the monks caught a snake in the fire-house, he volunteered to get rid of it. He secretly tried to make it bite him, even putting his finger in its mouth, but the snake would not bite. He told the monks it was harmless, though they disagreed. Then he took a razor intending to cut his own throat. At that very moment, as he was about to end his life, he reflected on his flawless moral conduct during his time as a monk. This reflection led to meditation, and in that instant of focused effort, he attained Arahantship. He told the monks that he had intended to cut his own throat but instead had cut off all his defilements. The monks thought he was lying and told the Buddha. The Buddha confirmed it was true and explained that in a previous life during the time of Buddha Kassapa, the snake had been this monk's slave, which is why it didn't bite him (hence he became known as the Snake-Slave Elder). The Buddha also explained that he had been discontented and on the verge of giving up even in that previous life after twenty thousand years of practice. The monks wondered if it was truly possible to attain Arahantship so quickly. The Buddha spoke this verse, explaining that it was possible for an energetic monk to achieve Arahantship even within the time it takes to lift and lower one's foot, but a lazy monk could not achieve it in a hundred years. Though the Snake-Slave Elder had been lazy for a long time, his single moment of intense, focused effort was worth more than all his previous years of half-hearted practice. That one day - indeed, that one moment - of fierce effort brought complete liberation."

They lived simply in a remote village. When pregnant, she wished to return to her parents' home to give birth, but her husband refused, fearing punishment. She left secretly, but he caught up with her. She gave birth on the journey. When pregnant again, the same happened, but this time a storm arose. Her husband went to cut wood for shelter but was bitten by a poisonous snake and died. She waited all night in the storm, protecting her children with her body, and gave birth to her second child. In the morning, she found her dead husband. Distraught, she continued toward Sāvatthī. At the flooded river Aciravatī, she was too weak to carry both children across at once. She left her older son on the bank and carried her baby across. Halfway back, a hawk swooped down on her baby. She screamed and waved, but her elder son, thinking she was calling him, jumped into the river and was swept away. Both children died. When she reached Sāvatthī, she learned her family home had been destroyed in the storm and her parents and brother had all perished. Completely insane with grief, she wandered naked. At Jetavana monastery, the Buddha addressed her as 'sister,' restoring her sanity. She covered herself and listened as the Buddha taught her about the suffering of saṁsāra. She attained Stream-entry and became a nun. Some time later, while washing her feet, she noticed how water flowed away in three stages - some drops close to her, some farther away, some still farther. This simple observation triggered deep meditation on impermanence. The Buddha, seeing her readiness with his Divine Eye, projected himself before her and spoke this verse. At its conclusion, Paṭācārā attained Arahantship.

She married a rich young man and a son was born to them. The boy died when he was just a toddler and Kisāgotamī was stricken with grief. Carrying the dead body of her son, she went about asking for medicine that would restore her son to life from everyone she happened to meet. People began to think that she had gone mad. But a wise man, seeing her condition, thought he should help her. He said, 'The Buddha is the person you should approach, he has the medicine you want; go to him.' Thus, she went to the Buddha and asked him to give her the medicine that would restore her son to life. The Buddha told her to get some mustard seeds from a house where there had been no death. Carrying her dead child, Kisāgotamī went from house to house with the request for mustard seeds. Everyone was willing to help her, but she could not find a single house where death had not occurred. Then, she realized that hers was not the only family that had faced death and that there were more people dead than living. As soon as she realized this, her attitude towards her dead son changed; she was no longer attached to the dead body. She left the corpse in the jungle and returned to the Buddha. The Buddha said, 'Gotamī, you thought that you alone had lost a son. As you have now realized, death comes to all beings; before their desires are fulfilled, death takes them away.' On hearing this, Kisāgotamī fully realized the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality of the aggregates and attained Stream-entry. Soon afterwards, Kisāgotamī became a nun. One day, as she was lighting lamps, she saw the flames flaring up and dying out, and suddenly she clearly perceived the arising and perishing of beings. The Buddha, through supernormal power, saw her from his monastery and sent forth his radiance, appearing before her. Kisāgotamī was told to continue meditating on the impermanent nature of all beings and to strive hard to realize Nibbāna. The Buddha spoke this verse, and at its conclusion, Kisāgotamī attained Arahantship, seeing the Deathless State."

Then, the father died and the mother kept all the property without giving anything to the children. Her sons and daughters wanted the inheritance, so they said to their mother, 'What benefit do we get from our property? Can't we make it multiply? Can't we look after our mother?' They said such things again and again, so their mother thought that her children would look after her, and she finally divided up the property without leaving anything for herself. After the division of property, she first went to stay with her eldest son, but her daughter-in-law complained and said, 'She has come and stayed with us, as if she has given us two shares!' So Bahuputtika (as she came to be known - 'mother of many children') went to stay with her second son, and the same things were said. Thus, she went from one son to another, from one daughter to the next; but none of them was willing to take her on for a long period and none paid her due respect. The old lady was hurt and felt bitter against her children. She left her family and became a nun. Bahuputtika realized that she became a nun only in her old age and that she must not be negligent, but must make use of the remaining period of her life to the utmost. So, for the whole night, she meditated on the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. The Buddha, seeing her from the Jetavana monastery through supernormal power, sent forth his radiance and appeared seated in front of her. Then the Buddha said to her, 'The life of one who does not practice the Dhamma taught by me is useless, even if he were to live for a hundred years.' The Buddha spoke this verse, emphasizing that even one day spent comprehending the Supreme Dhamma - the path to liberation - is worth more than a century lived in ignorance. At the conclusion of the verse, Bahuputtika attained Arahantship, fulfilling the potential of her human life despite beginning her practice only in old age."
