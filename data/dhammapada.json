                    "translation": "Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.",
                    "commentary": "This verse establishes the fundamental Buddhist principle that the mind is the forerunner of all mental phenomena. All our experiences, whether pleasant or unpleasant, originate from the mind. When we act or speak with a corrupted mind filled with greed, hatred, or delusion, suffering inevitably follows us, just as the wheel of a cart follows the hoof of the ox pulling it. The simile emphasizes the inescapable nature of this cause-and-effect relationship.",

                        "content": "Cakkhupāla was a monk who became blind while meditating. Some monks accused him of killing insects, but the Buddha defended him, explaining that Cakkhupāla had attained Arahantship and could not intentionally harm any living being. The Buddha then revealed that in a past life, Cakkhupāla had been a physician who intentionally blinded a woman. That unwholesome action resulted in his blindness in this life, demonstrating how suffering follows evil actions. However, through his pure practice in this life, he attained liberation, showing that present wholesome actions lead to freedom from suffering."

When our mind is pure, filled with loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom, happiness naturally follows all our actions. Just as a shadow never leaves its object when the sun shines, happiness accompanies those who cultivate wholesome mental states. Together, these first two verses underscore the profound impact of mental purity on one's well-being and emphasize the importance of cultivating a pure mind.",

When he fell ill and was dying, his father wouldn't even call a physician. The Buddha, seeing the boy's potential, visited him. Upon seeing the Buddha, Maṭṭakuṇḍali developed a pure, joyful mind filled with faith. He died with this wholesome mental state and was reborn in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven. This story illustrates how even a brief moment of pure mind at the time of death can lead to a fortunate rebirth and happiness."

When we constantly replay past wrongs in our minds, dwelling on how we were abused, struck, defeated, or robbed, we keep our hatred alive and prevent it from subsiding. The act of harboring such thoughts perpetuates animosity and prevents inner peace. This verse teaches that the problem is not just the original wrong, but our continued mental engagement with it.",

His mind became disturbed, and he could not progress in his meditation. The Buddha, knowing his mental state, taught him these verses about letting go of grudges. Upon hearing the teaching, Tissa realized the futility of holding onto resentment. He immediately let go of his anger and, with a peaceful mind, soon attained Arahantship."

                    "commentary": "This verse provides the solution to the problem presented in verse 3. By choosing not to dwell on past wrongs, by consciously deciding not to harbor thoughts of resentment, we allow our hatred to naturally subside and cease. Peace comes from our own decision to release resentment and forgive. This is not about condoning wrongdoing, but about freeing ourselves from the mental burden of hatred. The verse emphasizes that we have control over our mental states and can choose peace over perpetual anger.",

The Buddha tried to reconcile them, but they were too attached to their positions. Eventually, the Buddha left them and spent the rains retreat alone in the forest. The lay supporters, disappointed by the monks' behavior, stopped supporting them. Humbled and realizing their mistake, the monks let go of their grudges and reconciled. Once they stopped harboring thoughts of past wrongs, harmony was immediately restored, demonstrating the power of letting go."

                    "commentary": "This is one of the most famous and profound verses in the Dhammapada. It proclaims the timeless truth that responding to hatred with more hatred only perpetuates the cycle of conflict and suffering. Only through the absence of hatred—through love, compassion, and forgiveness—can animosity truly end. This eternal law (sanantano dhammo) applies universally, across all times and places. It is a fundamental principle of Buddhist ethics and a practical guide for resolving conflicts at all levels, from personal relationships to international disputes.",

Their son, Prince Dīghāvu, was born in hiding. When Dīghāvu was a young man, King Brahmadatta captured and executed King Dīghīti. Before his death, Dīghīti whispered to his son: 'Do not look long, do not look short'—meaning do not perpetuate hatred or be hasty in revenge. Later, Dīghāvu had the opportunity to kill King Brahmadatta but chose not to, remembering his father's words. When he revealed his identity and his father's final teaching, King Brahmadatta was deeply moved. He restored Dīghāvu's kingdom and the two became friends. The Buddha used this story to illustrate that hatred can only be overcome by non-hatred."

                    "commentary": "This verse points out that many quarrels and conflicts arise from ignorance of our mortality and the impermanent nature of existence. People who do not understand that life is fleeting and that death comes to all engage in petty disputes and harbor grudges. However, those who truly comprehend the reality of death and impermanence see the futility of such conflicts. This understanding of our shared mortality brings perspective and wisdom, leading to the cessation of quarrels. The wise (medhagā) who realize this truth naturally let go of their disputes and live in peace.",

They acted as if they would live forever and as if their disagreement was of ultimate importance. The Buddha reminded them of the impermanence of life and the certainty of death. When the monks reflected on this teaching and realized that they were wasting their precious human life on petty conflicts, they were filled with remorse. Understanding that death could come at any moment and that their time for practice was limited, they immediately settled their quarrel and returned to harmonious living and diligent practice."

                    "commentary": "This verse describes the vulnerability of those who live heedlessly. Mara (representing temptation, defilements, and death) easily overcomes those who: (1) contemplate only pleasant things and seek sensual pleasures, (2) have unguarded sense faculties, allowing unwholesome impressions to enter freely, (3) are immoderate in eating, lacking restraint in consumption, (4) are lazy and lacking in energy for spiritual practice. Such a person is compared to a weak tree that is easily uprooted by a storm. Without the strength of virtue, mindfulness, and effort, one is defenseless against the forces of defilement.",

Though he had faith in the Buddha, he lacked the discipline to follow the path seriously. One day, he fell seriously ill. On his deathbed, he saw a vision of hell and became terrified. He called for the Buddha, who came and taught him to focus his mind on wholesome thoughts. With great effort, Mahākāla managed to purify his mind before death and avoided an unfortunate rebirth. The Buddha used this example to teach that those who live heedlessly are like weak trees, easily overcome by Mara, and must exert great effort to avoid suffering."

                    "commentary": "This verse presents the opposite of verse 7, describing the strength of those who practice diligently. Mara cannot overcome those who: (1) contemplate impurities (asubha) to counter attachment to the body and sensual pleasures, (2) guard their sense faculties with mindfulness, (3) practice moderation in eating, (4) possess faith (saddhā) in the Triple Gem, and (5) arouse sustained energy (viriya) for practice. Such a person is compared to a solid rocky mountain that remains unmoved by storms. This verse emphasizes that spiritual strength comes from disciplined practice and mental cultivation.",

He meditated on the impurities of the body, guarded his senses carefully, ate moderately, and maintained strong faith and energy. Though Mara tried many times to distract him with sensual temptations and doubts, Cūḷakāla remained unmoved, like a mountain in a storm. Through his steadfast practice, he attained Arahantship. The Buddha praised him as an example of one who, through discipline and effort, becomes invincible to Mara's attacks. The contrast between the two brothers illustrates the different outcomes of heedless versus diligent living."

The yellow or saffron robe (kāsāva) is the traditional garment of Buddhist monks, symbolizing renunciation and purity. However, merely wearing the robe does not make one a true renunciant. If a person is still stained with defilements (anikkasāvo), lacks self-control (dama), and is not truthful (sacca), they are not worthy of wearing the robe, regardless of their outward appearance. True monasticism requires inner transformation, not just external conformity.",

Though he wore the yellow robe, he was filled with evil intentions. He tried to kill the Buddha, created a schism in the Sangha, and committed other grave offenses. Despite his monastic appearance, Devadatta was not worthy of the robe because he lacked self-control, truthfulness, and moral integrity. Eventually, his evil actions led to his downfall—he was swallowed by the earth and reborn in hell. The Buddha used Devadatta as an example of one who wears the robe but is unworthy of it due to inner corruption."

Such a person has: (1) purged all defilements and moral stains (vantakasāva), (2) become well-established in virtuous conduct (sīlesu susamāhito), (3) developed self-control over body, speech, and mind (dama), and (4) cultivated truthfulness and integrity (sacca). When these inner qualities are present, the wearing of the yellow robe is appropriate and meaningful.

Before ordaining, he was already seeking truth earnestly. After hearing just one verse of the Dhamma, he attained the first stage of enlightenment. As a monk, he was renowned for his virtue, wisdom, self-control, and absolute truthfulness. He never spoke a false word, even in jest. His mind was completely purged of defilements, and he was perfectly established in ethical conduct. The Buddha often praised Sāriputta as one who was truly worthy of the yellow robe, embodying all the qualities of a genuine renunciant. His life demonstrated that the robe's true value lies in the purity of the wearer."

Many people mistake the unessential (asāra)—such as wealth, status, sensual pleasures, and material possessions—for what is essential (sāra). Conversely, they regard the essential—such as virtue, wisdom, mental purification, and liberation—as unessential or unimportant.

They considered these worldly topics interesting and important, while viewing meditation and study of the teachings as boring and unimportant. They wore the robes and lived in the monastery but never engaged seriously with the practice. Years passed, and they made no spiritual progress. When the Buddha learned of this, he admonished them with this verse, explaining that they had mistaken the unessential for the essential. Some of the monks, upon hearing this teaching, recognized their error and changed their ways, eventually making progress on the path. Others continued in their delusion and never attained the essential."

His passion for her was so strong that he could not concentrate on his practice. The Buddha, understanding his condition, used skillful means to help him. He took Nanda to the heavenly realms and showed him celestial nymphs far more beautiful than his wife, promising these as a reward for practice. This motivated Nanda to develop his mind through meditation.

He practiced mindfulness of the body, contemplation of impurity, and other meditation subjects that countered sensual desire. As his concentration deepened and his wisdom grew, his mind became like a well-thatched house. The passion that had previously tormented him could no longer penetrate his consciousness. Even when he recalled his beautiful wife or thought of the celestial nymphs, his well-developed mind remained unmoved. Eventually, he realized that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. With this insight, he attained Arahantship, and his mind became completely liberated from all forms of passion. The Buddha used Nanda's transformation as an example of how a well-developed mind becomes invincible."

The Buddha confirmed that even celestial beings honor such accomplished Arahants."

So he ran away and went to a monastery where he was made a samanera. He took a meditation subject and left for an acacia forest thirty yojanas away. At the end of the vassa, he attained arahatship. The Buddha accompanied by Thera Sariputta and five hundred other bhikkhus set out to visit him. The journey was long and rough, but the devas looked to all their needs. Revata created special monasteries by supernormal power. On their return, they came to Visakha's house, who offered them alms-food. After the meal, Visakha asked the Buddha if the place of Revata in the acacia forest was pleasant.

However, those who are free from passion (vītarāga) - the Arahants - delight in such secluded places precisely because they are conducive to meditation and peace. Arahants do not seek sensual pleasures (kāma), so the absence of worldly attractions is no disadvantage to them.

He thought, 'I have done many evil deeds, I should make merit by offering rice gruel to this monk.' He invited the elder, offered the gruel, and stood fanning him. Seeing that the man was famished, the elder told him to eat and called someone else to fan him. Then he taught him the Dhamma. Unable to concentrate due to remorse, the executioner was troubled. The elder skillfully questioned him about whether he had wished to kill all those people, or whether another had made him do it. He replied that the king made him do it. The elder asked, 'In that case, what evil have you done?' This relieved his guilt enough for him to concentrate on the Dhamma talk. He gained a high stage of insight knowledge and died that same day, being reborn in the Tuṣita heaven. The Buddha explained that his fortunate rebirth was due to the excellent, beneficial advice of the Elder Sāriputta - one meaningful teaching that brought him peace."

The locals thought he was an Arahant, and because of their adulation, he came to believe it himself. In a former life, Bāhiya had been one of seven monks who isolated themselves on a mountain ledge attempting to attain the goal. The eldest attained Arahantship and the second attained Non-returning, but Bāhiya and four others died in the attempt. The second monk, reborn in the Brahma realm, saw Bāhiya's plight and came to advise him that he was not an Arahant. He told him the true Arahant, the Buddha, was dwelling at Sāvatthī. At once, Bāhiya set off and with celestial help arrived the next morning while the Buddha was on his alms-round. Bāhiya repeatedly requested the Dhamma teaching. Seeing that his mind was now equanimous, the Buddha taught him: 'Bāhiya, train yourself like this — when you see something, just know that you see it; when you hear something, just know that you hear it. When, Bāhiya, for you in the seen is merely what is seen, in the known is merely the known, then you will not be with that. When you are not with that, then you will not be in that. When you are not in that, then you will be neither here, nor beyond, nor in between. Just this is the end of suffering.' As the Buddha was teaching this brief Dhamma, the mind of Bāhiya was freed from all defilements. Shortly afterwards, Bāhiya was gored to death by a cow. The Buddha told the monks to cremate his body and build a stūpa as Bāhiya had attained Arahantship through just a few meaningful verses."

External rituals, however ancient or elaborate, cannot compete with honoring one who has achieved internal purification. This was a radical teaching that challenged the prevailing religious orthodoxy of fire-sacrifice and ritual worship.",

Every month, he would sacrifice an animal to tend the sacrificial fire, believing this would lead to rebirth in the Brahma realm. He devoted enormous effort to maintaining the sacred fire and performing the prescribed rituals exactly as taught by his teachers. The Elder Sāriputta, concerned for his nephew's spiritual welfare, went to visit him. He gently explained that neither his nephew nor his teachers actually possessed direct knowledge of the path to the Brahma realm. Their practices were based on tradition and belief, not on personal realization. The Elder took his nephew to meet the Buddha, who taught him that a century spent tending the sacred fire could not equal a moment spent honoring someone who had truly perfected themselves through the Buddha's teaching. The Buddha explained that external fire-rituals, while they might generate some merit, could never match the merit of honoring one who had extinguished the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion within themselves. The nephew, deeply moved by this teaching and recognizing its profound truth, abandoned his fire-sacrifices and became a devoted follower of the Buddha, seeking to purify his own mind rather than tending external fires."

Every year, he would organize a grand sacrificial ceremony, slaughtering many animals and distributing gifts to Brahmins, believing this would generate great merit and secure a favorable rebirth. He spent enormous sums on these annual festivals and took great pride in their scale and magnificence. The Elder Sāriputta, remembering their friendship and concerned for his friend's spiritual welfare, decided to visit him. He found his friend busily preparing for yet another grand sacrifice. The Elder gently suggested that there might be a better way to generate merit. His friend was skeptical - how could anything surpass the merit of his grand annual sacrifices? The Elder took him to meet the Buddha. The Buddha taught him that all his year-long offerings and sacrifices did not equal even one-fourth of the merit gained from showing genuine reverence to those who had perfected themselves in virtue and wisdom. The Buddha explained that while material offerings had their place, they paled in comparison to the spiritual benefit of honoring and learning from the truly virtuous. The friend, deeply impressed by the Buddha's wisdom and recognizing the superficiality of his ritualistic approach, became a devoted follower. He redirected his resources from animal sacrifices to supporting the Sangha and, more importantly, devoted himself to cultivating virtue and wisdom in his own life."

After forty-eight years of practice together, one returned to household life, married, and started a family. When his son was born, he visited his former companion to pay respects and receive a blessing. The ascetic blessed him and his wife with the words 'Long-life to you,' but he did not bless the newborn son. When asked why, the ascetic said that the boy would die within seven days, but suggested that the recluse Gotama might know how to prevent it. The anxious father took his son to the Buddha, who could see the child's past kamma that would lead to his death. However, the Buddha, in his compassion, devised a plan. He instructed the father to erect a pavilion at the door of his house and invite the monks to recite the Protection Discourses continuously for seven days and nights. During this time, the father and his family showed utmost respect and reverence to the monks, serving them with devotion. On the seventh day, the Buddha himself came to recite the texts. On the morning of the eighth day, the danger had passed. The Buddha blessed the child with long life, saying he would live for one hundred and twenty years, and the boy was named Āyuvaḍḍhana - 'increase of life.' When the monks discussed how the child gained long life through the Buddha's compassion, the Buddha spoke this verse, explaining that it was actually the family's respectful service and honoring of the virtuous monks that generated the merit to overcome the child's negative kamma. The four blessings of long life, beauty, happiness, and strength naturally increased for those who constantly honored the worthy with sincerity."

The bandits took him to their lair and prepared to kill him. The novice entered jhāna, and his mind became so powerful and peaceful that when the ringleader tried to execute him with his sword, it bounced off his neck. He tried again, but his sword shattered. Terrified and amazed, the bandit prostrated himself, begged forgiveness, listened to the Dhamma, and asked to become a monk. All the bandits followed suit. The novice gave them the going-forth and returned to inform the other monks, who were still meditating peacefully in the forest. He took his disciples to the Buddha and related what had happened.

Tired from his journey, he sat on a flat rock to rest and entered jhāna meditation. That night, a large group of thieves who had plundered a village came to the same spot carrying their stolen goods. In the darkness, they mistook the meditating elder for a tree stump and piled all their loot over his head before lying down to sleep. At dawn, when they awoke and saw it was actually a monk sitting in meditation, they were terrified, thinking he might be a non-human spirit or deity. The elder calmly told them not to be alarmed and explained that he was merely a monk practicing meditation. The thieves were astounded by his composure and unshakeable peace. They fell at his feet asking forgiveness for their disrespect. The elder taught them the Dhamma, and they were so moved by his wisdom and the peace evident in his meditation that they asked him to give them ordination. He ordained all of them on the spot and brought them to the Buddha. When the monks heard this story, they marveled at how these thieves, who had lived many years in wickedness, were transformed in a single encounter with a wise and meditative monk. The Buddha spoke this verse to explain that the elder's one day of life - lived with wisdom and meditation so profound that he remained unmoved even when thieves piled stolen goods on his head - was worth more than a hundred years lived foolishly and without mental cultivation. This is why he became known as Tree-stump Koṇḍañña, and his single day of wisdom and meditation had transformed an entire band of criminals into monks on the path to liberation."

Despair overcame him, and he wanted to end his life. One day, when the monks caught a snake in the fire-house, he volunteered to get rid of it. He secretly tried to make it bite him, even putting his finger in its mouth, but the snake would not bite. He told the monks it was harmless, though they disagreed. Then he took a razor intending to cut his own throat. At that very moment, as he was about to end his life, he reflected on his flawless moral conduct during his time as a monk. This reflection led to meditation, and in that instant of focused effort, he attained Arahantship. He told the monks that he had intended to cut his own throat but instead had cut off all his defilements. The monks thought he was lying and told the Buddha. The Buddha confirmed it was true and explained that in a previous life during the time of Buddha Kassapa, the snake had been this monk's slave, which is why it didn't bite him (hence he became known as the Snake-Slave Elder). The Buddha also explained that he had been discontented and on the verge of giving up even in that previous life after twenty thousand years of practice. The monks wondered if it was truly possible to attain Arahantship so quickly. The Buddha spoke this verse, explaining that it was possible for an energetic monk to achieve Arahantship even within the time it takes to lift and lower one's foot, but a lazy monk could not achieve it in a hundred years. Though the Snake-Slave Elder had been lazy for a long time, his single moment of intense, focused effort was worth more than all his previous years of half-hearted practice. That one day - indeed, that one moment - of fierce effort brought complete liberation."

They lived simply in a remote village. When pregnant, she wished to return to her parents' home to give birth, but her husband refused, fearing punishment. She left secretly, but he caught up with her. She gave birth on the journey. When pregnant again, the same happened, but this time a storm arose. Her husband went to cut wood for shelter but was bitten by a poisonous snake and died. She waited all night in the storm, protecting her children with her body, and gave birth to her second child. In the morning, she found her dead husband. Distraught, she continued toward Sāvatthī. At the flooded river Aciravatī, she was too weak to carry both children across at once. She left her older son on the bank and carried her baby across. Halfway back, a hawk swooped down on her baby. She screamed and waved, but her elder son, thinking she was calling him, jumped into the river and was swept away. Both children died. When she reached Sāvatthī, she learned her family home had been destroyed in the storm and her parents and brother had all perished. Completely insane with grief, she wandered naked. At Jetavana monastery, the Buddha addressed her as 'sister,' restoring her sanity. She covered herself and listened as the Buddha taught her about the suffering of saṁsāra. She attained Stream-entry and became a nun. Some time later, while washing her feet, she noticed how water flowed away in three stages - some drops close to her, some farther away, some still farther. This simple observation triggered deep meditation on impermanence. The Buddha, seeing her readiness with his Divine Eye, projected himself before her and spoke this verse. At its conclusion, Paṭācārā attained Arahantship.

She married a rich young man and a son was born to them. The boy died when he was just a toddler and Kisāgotamī was stricken with grief. Carrying the dead body of her son, she went about asking for medicine that would restore her son to life from everyone she happened to meet. People began to think that she had gone mad. But a wise man, seeing her condition, thought he should help her. He said, 'The Buddha is the person you should approach, he has the medicine you want; go to him.' Thus, she went to the Buddha and asked him to give her the medicine that would restore her son to life. The Buddha told her to get some mustard seeds from a house where there had been no death. Carrying her dead child, Kisāgotamī went from house to house with the request for mustard seeds. Everyone was willing to help her, but she could not find a single house where death had not occurred. Then, she realized that hers was not the only family that had faced death and that there were more people dead than living. As soon as she realized this, her attitude towards her dead son changed; she was no longer attached to the dead body. She left the corpse in the jungle and returned to the Buddha. The Buddha said, 'Gotamī, you thought that you alone had lost a son. As you have now realized, death comes to all beings; before their desires are fulfilled, death takes them away.' On hearing this, Kisāgotamī fully realized the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality of the aggregates and attained Stream-entry. Soon afterwards, Kisāgotamī became a nun. One day, as she was lighting lamps, she saw the flames flaring up and dying out, and suddenly she clearly perceived the arising and perishing of beings. The Buddha, through supernormal power, saw her from his monastery and sent forth his radiance, appearing before her. Kisāgotamī was told to continue meditating on the impermanent nature of all beings and to strive hard to realize Nibbāna. The Buddha spoke this verse, and at its conclusion, Kisāgotamī attained Arahantship, seeing the Deathless State."

Then, the father died and the mother kept all the property without giving anything to the children. Her sons and daughters wanted the inheritance, so they said to their mother, 'What benefit do we get from our property? Can't we make it multiply? Can't we look after our mother?' They said such things again and again, so their mother thought that her children would look after her, and she finally divided up the property without leaving anything for herself. After the division of property, she first went to stay with her eldest son, but her daughter-in-law complained and said, 'She has come and stayed with us, as if she has given us two shares!' So Bahuputtika (as she came to be known - 'mother of many children') went to stay with her second son, and the same things were said. Thus, she went from one son to another, from one daughter to the next; but none of them was willing to take her on for a long period and none paid her due respect. The old lady was hurt and felt bitter against her children. She left her family and became a nun. Bahuputtika realized that she became a nun only in her old age and that she must not be negligent, but must make use of the remaining period of her life to the utmost. So, for the whole night, she meditated on the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. The Buddha, seeing her from the Jetavana monastery through supernormal power, sent forth his radiance and appeared seated in front of her. Then the Buddha said to her, 'The life of one who does not practice the Dhamma taught by me is useless, even if he were to live for a hundred years.' The Buddha spoke this verse, emphasizing that even one day spent comprehending the Supreme Dhamma - the path to liberation - is worth more than a century lived in ignorance. At the conclusion of the verse, Bahuputtika attained Arahantship, fulfilling the potential of her human life despite beginning her practice only in old age."

The wife would go to hear the Buddha's teaching during the day wearing the upper garment, while the husband went at night. One night, while listening to the Dhamma, the Brahmin was inspired to offer his upper garment to the Buddha. However, meanness and hesitation overcame him repeatedly throughout the discourse. He kept thinking 'I will offer it' but then held back. This internal struggle continued - sometimes his generous impulse would arise, other times his attachment would prevail. Finally, near dawn, he summoned all his courage and decisively offered the garment to the Buddha, exclaiming loudly, 'I have won! I have won!' (over his stinginess). The king, who was also present, heard this exclamation and inquired about its meaning. When he learned the Brahmin's story and his victory over selfishness, the king was so moved that he rewarded the Brahmin with thirty-two fine garments and other gifts. The Buddha spoke this verse to emphasize that one must make haste in doing good, for if one delays, the mind will delight in evil (in this case, stinginess and attachment).

His co-resident, the Elder Lāḷudāyī, instead of guiding him properly toward overcoming his defilements through meditation and right effort, gave him inappropriate advice. He advised Seyyasaka to masturbate to relieve his sexual frustration, saying it was a minor offense. Venerable Seyyasaka followed this misguided advice and committed this offense. However, having done it once and found temporary relief, he did it again. Then again. Soon it became a habit, and he fell into the same offense repeatedly, finding pleasure in this wrong action. The matter came to the attention of other monks, who reported it to the Buddha. The Buddha severely reproved both Seyyasaka for his repeated misconduct and Lāḷudāyī for his wrong guidance. The Buddha spoke this verse, emphasizing that even if one commits an evil deed, one should not repeat it or take pleasure in it, for the accumulation of evil leads to great suffering. The Buddha explained that each repetition strengthens the unwholesome tendency and makes liberation more difficult. Seyyasaka, hearing this teaching and realizing the gravity of his actions, felt deep remorse and resolved to overcome his defilements through proper practice."

Every day, she would descend from her mansion to clean the grounds around the monastery and the dwelling place of a certain Elder monk whom she particularly revered. She did this work joyfully and with great devotion, taking pleasure in serving the Sangha. One day, the Elder monk returned early from his alms-round and saw her cleaning his dwelling. Not knowing she was a deity, and thinking she was an overly devoted human woman, he told her firmly to stop coming and to cease this service, as it might give rise to wrong perceptions. The deity was deeply hurt by this rejection of her service. She stood there weeping, heartbroken that she could no longer perform the meritorious deed that brought her such joy. The Buddha, observing this situation with his divine eye, knew the deity's pure motivation and the Elder's misunderstanding. He came to the scene and consoled the weeping deity. He explained to the Elder that this was actually a celestial being who took great delight in performing meritorious service, and there was no impropriety in allowing her to continue. The Buddha then spoke this verse, praising the deity's joyful accumulation of merit. He explained that just as she had repeatedly performed good deeds in her previous life (which led to her divine rebirth), and just as she continued to delight in merit-making even in her celestial existence, all beings should find pleasure in doing good repeatedly, for the accumulation of merit brings only happiness and bliss. The deity, hearing this teaching, attained the fruit of Stream-entry. The Elder also learned an important lesson about not discouraging others' wholesome enthusiasm in performing meritorious deeds."

He supported the Sangha so generously that he used up the greater part of his enormous fortune in building monasteries, offering alms, and supporting monks. As his wealth diminished, some people began to criticize him severely. They said he was foolish and reckless, wasting his family's inheritance on religious donations. They predicted he would end up a pauper. Even a guardian deity who lived in his house became concerned and appeared to him one night. The deity criticized him for his extravagant almsgiving and advised him to be more moderate and focus on rebuilding his business and wealth instead of giving everything away to monks. However, Anāthapiṇḍika ignored all this criticism and continued his generous acts without hesitation, confident in the Buddha's teaching about the fruits of generosity. At one point, his wealth was so depleted that people thought he was finished. But then, unexpectedly, ships that everyone thought had been lost at sea returned laden with valuable goods. Debtors who had been unable to pay suddenly repaid their loans. New business opportunities arose. Within a short time, Anāthapiṇḍika became even wealthier than before. The guardian deity, seeing this reversal, realized her mistake and came to beg for forgiveness. Anāthapiṇḍika, being compassionate, forgave her but took her to see the Buddha so she could receive proper teaching. The Buddha spoke these two verses (119 and 120) to illustrate how the ripening of karma works. He explained that wicked people may seem to prosper temporarily because they are still enjoying the fruits of their past good karma. But when that good karma is exhausted and their evil deeds ripen, they will face terrible consequences. Conversely, good people like Anāthapiṇḍika may face temporary difficulties when past negative karma ripens, but when their good deeds bear fruit, they experience abundant happiness and prosperity. This is why one should never judge the validity of karma by immediate results, but should have faith in its inevitable operation over time."

                        "content": "This verse was spoken together with verse 119 in the same context of Anāthapiṇḍika's story. When Anāthapiṇḍika brought the guardian deity to the Buddha, the Buddha elaborated on the principle of karmic ripening for both evil and good. He explained that Anāthapiṇḍika's temporary financial difficulties, despite his current virtuous actions, were due to some minor negative karma from the past that needed to exhaust itself. The Buddha might have been referring to instances in Anāthapiṇḍika's past when he was building his merchant empire and may have engaged in some of the harsh business practices common to merchants. But because Anāthapiṇḍika continued to perform good deeds with pure motivation, not discouraged by temporary setbacks, his abundant good karma eventually ripened, bringing him even greater wealth than before. The Buddha used this example to teach that one should not be discouraged from doing good even when facing difficulties, nor should one feel proud when experiencing good fortune, thinking oneself exempt from consequences of past misdeeds. The key is to understand that both good and evil karma will ripen in their own time according to conditions. The wise person continues to cultivate virtue regardless of present circumstances, knowing that wholesome actions will inevitably bear wholesome fruit. Similarly, one should not be deceived by the temporary prosperity of the wicked or the temporary suffering of the good. These are merely surface appearances that will change when different karmic seeds ripen. This teaching gave great confidence to Anāthapiṇḍika and the deity, and strengthened their faith in the Dhamma and the law of karma."

After using beds, chairs, and other monastery equipment, he would leave them outside without putting them away properly. The rain would damage them, and white ants would eat into the wood. When other monks advised him to be more careful and to put things away after use, he dismissed their concerns saying, 'This is such a small matter. What harm can it do? These are just material things. Why worry about such trifles?' He continued his careless behavior, leaving monastery property exposed to the elements day after day. The damage gradually accumulated. What had been good furniture slowly deteriorated. The other monks became increasingly concerned, not just about the material loss but about this monk's attitude of dismissing small wrongdoings. They felt this casual attitude toward minor infractions could lead to greater misconduct. Finally, they reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha summoned the careless monk and admonished him strongly. The Buddha explained that he should not disregard even a slight wrong, thinking it wouldn't matter or wouldn't affect him. The Buddha spoke this verse, using the simile of the water jar. He explained: 'Just as a large jar becomes completely full by the accumulation of tiny water drops, one drop at a time, so too does a fool become filled with evil by accumulating small misdeeds, bit by bit. You think these small acts of carelessness don't matter, but they accumulate. Your mind is being trained in carelessness and disregard for rules. Today it is furniture left outside. Tomorrow it might be more serious precepts you regard lightly. The pattern of dismissing small wrongs is itself a great wrong, for it leads to greater transgressions.' Chastened by this teaching, the monk recognized his error. He realized that his attitude of 'it's just a small thing' was actually developing an unwholesome character trait. He reformed his behavior and became careful even about minor matters. The Buddha also used this occasion to lay down a formal training rule for all monks to properly care for and put away monastery property after use, preventing damage from weather and pests. This rule helps train monks in mindfulness and respect for material requisites, and prevents the gradual accumulation of carelessness and disregard for rules."

He got his nickname (which means 'one who gives a lick') because he was so stingy that when he ate sweet foods, he wouldn't give even a lick to anyone else - not even to his own wife or children. He hoarded his wealth and never gave anything in charity. He wouldn't even spend money on good food for himself, eating only the cheapest meals. When he wanted to eat something special, he would take his wife to a secret chamber in his house where no one could see them, and they would eat alone, making sure not a morsel was seen by anyone else who might ask for a share. He thought to himself: 'Why should I waste my wealth on others? Why should I do good deeds that give away my money? Such small acts of giving won't make any difference anyway. What benefit could come from a few small acts of charity?' Despite his wealth, he died without ever enjoying it or using it for any good purpose. After death, due to his extreme miserliness and lack of any merit from generosity, he was reborn as a preta (hungry ghost) in the hell realm, suffering from constant hunger and thirst. His enormous wealth was inherited by the king's treasury, as he had no heirs who knew where he had hidden it all. Meanwhile, his wife, who had gone along with his miserly ways, also died and was reborn in a similar state of misery. Some monks, knowing this story, asked the Buddha about Bīlālapadaka's fate. The Buddha related his current state of suffering and explained that his miserliness had prevented him from accumulating any merit. The Buddha then spoke this verse to teach the opposite lesson - that one should not dismiss small acts of merit, thinking they won't make a difference. He explained: 'Just as a vessel becomes full by the accumulation of small drops of water, so too does a wise person become filled with merit by accumulating small good deeds, bit by bit. Bīlālapadaka thought small acts of generosity wouldn't matter or benefit him, so he did no good at all. But if he had understood this principle, he could have enjoyed his wealth by using it skillfully for both his own happiness and the welfare of others, and he would have accumulated merit that would have led to a fortunate rebirth.' The Buddha emphasized that no good deed is too small to matter. Each small act of kindness, each small offering, each small service to others accumulates. A smile, a kind word, offering a drink of water, helping someone with a small task - these all accumulate to create a character of goodness and generate positive karma. The wise person understands this and never misses an opportunity to do even small good deeds, knowing they accumulate into great benefit."

His caravan was large, but most of the travelers were not fighters - they were fellow merchants, their families, and servants. The group had little protection against robbers. Accompanying the caravan were several monks who were also traveling to their destination. Word reached a band of robbers that a wealthy merchant with a large caravan but little security was passing through their region. The robbers began to plan an ambush, intending to rob the caravan and possibly harm or kill those who resisted. However, the merchant had heard rumors about these robbers and their dangerous territory. Being a wise man, he decided to alter his route, even though it would take longer. He told the caravan they would avoid the main road through the dangerous area and instead take a longer, more circuitous route through safer territory. Some travelers complained about the delay, but the merchant insisted, saying it was better to arrive late than not to arrive at all. His caution proved wise. The robbers waited in vain for the caravan on the main road, while the merchant and his group safely passed through an alternate route and reached their destination without incident. The monks who were traveling with the caravan witnessed all this. When they continued on to visit the Buddha, they related this story to him, commenting on the merchant's wisdom in avoiding danger. The Buddha replied that this was indeed wise, and then spoke this verse. He explained: 'Just as that merchant, carrying great wealth with little protection, wisely avoided the dangerous road where robbers lay in wait, so too should all beings avoid evil deeds with great care. Just as a person who wishes to live carefully avoids consuming poison, so should one carefully avoid evil actions, evil speech, and evil thoughts. The merchant understood that the risk of taking the dangerous route far outweighed the inconvenience of taking a longer path. Similarly, one should understand that the consequences of evil - both in this life and in future lives - far outweigh any temporary pleasure or advantage that might be gained from wrongdoing.' The Buddha further explained that evil actions are like poison - they may sometimes be attractive or seem beneficial in the moment, but they lead to suffering and death (spiritual death, or rebirth in lower realms). Just as no one knowingly drinks poison hoping to live, no one should engage in evil hoping for happiness. The monks and other listeners deeply appreciated this teaching and became even more careful in avoiding all forms of evil, understanding that the consequences of evil are as dangerous as robbers to a wealthy merchant or poison to one who desires to live."

                        "content": "In a village near Sāvatthī, there lived a rich man's daughter who had attained the fruit of Stream-Entry (Sotāpanna) through hearing the Buddha's teachings. Despite her spiritual attainment, owing to strong past karma, she fell in love with a hunter. Her parents were horrified - their daughter, who had achieved such a high spiritual state, wanted to marry a man who made his living by killing animals! They tried to dissuade her, but the karmic connection was too strong. Eventually, she eloped with the hunter and went to live with him in the forest. They lived a simple life in a small hut in the jungle, and she gave birth to several sons. Although she was a Stream-Winner who understood the Dhamma and had eliminated certain defilements, she continued to live with her husband and even assisted him in his work. When the hunter would go out to hunt, she would give him his bow and arrows. She would help him prepare the meat of the animals he killed. To outward appearances, she was fully participating in the livelihood of killing. Other monks who knew about her past and her attainment of Stream-Entry were disturbed by this situation. They thought she had fallen from her attainment, or that she must be accumulating terrible karma by helping her husband kill animals. They reported this matter to the Buddha, expressing their concern and confusion. How could a Stream-Winner be involved in such activities? The Buddha explained the situation using this verse. He said: 'This woman has no wound - she has attained Stream-Entry and eliminated the view of self, doubt, and attachment to rites and rituals. Though she lives with a hunter and outwardly assists him, she does not actually commit the evil of killing. She does no wrong herself. Her mind remains pure, without the intention to kill or harm. She is merely supporting her husband as a wife, but she creates no killing karma herself because she commits no act of killing with the intention to kill.' The Buddha continued: 'Just as poison cannot harm a hand that has no wound in it, so evil cannot truly harm one who does no evil. Though she handles the weapons of killing and lives in an environment of killing, she herself does not kill, does not intend to kill, and does not rejoice in killing. Therefore, the evil of killing does not touch her, just as poison placed in an unwounded hand does not enter the body.' The Buddha further explained that due to her attainment of Stream-Entry, it was impossible for her to deliberately kill any living being. Even though past karma had brought her to live in these circumstances, her mind remained pure of that particular evil. The monks asked whether she wouldn't accumulate bad karma through association and assistance. The Buddha clarified that while there might be minor negative consequences from such close association with wrong livelihood, she was not creating the heavy karma of killing because she lacked the direct intention and action of killing. Her hands were 'unwounded' - her mind was free from the defilement of cruelty and the intention to harm. This teaching illustrates an important principle: it is primarily one's own intentional actions and the state of one's own mind that determine one's karma and spiritual state. While we should certainly avoid proximity to evil and avoid even the appearance of wrongdoing, the crucial factor is whether we ourselves engage in wrong action with wrong intention. This verse has also been interpreted to refer to Arahants who, having completely purified their minds of all defilements, can be exposed to evil influences without being corrupted by them, just as poison cannot harm an unwounded hand. They may live in the world surrounded by various forms of evil, but because they do no evil themselves and have no defilements through which evil could take root, they remain completely pure and untainted."

The paccekabuddha was on his alms-round walking peacefully through the forest. Koka, driven by evil thoughts or perhaps just cruel sport, shot an arrow at the innocent Sunetta. The arrow struck the paccekabuddha, who died from the wound. This was a grave evil - killing an enlightened being who had harmed no one and was completely pure and blameless. The consequences came swiftly. Koka returned to his village, but his evil deed had created immediate karmic results. The very same day, the earth opened up beneath him and he fell into Avīci, the most terrible hell realm, where he experienced unimaginable suffering. The Buddha related this story and spoke this verse to show that harming the innocent and pure brings immediate and severe consequences. Just as dust thrown against the wind flies back into the face of the thrower, so evil done to the blameless returns to harm the evildoer."

That very evening, as he was walking home, a cow that had just given birth to a calf became agitated and gored him to death. The monks found his body and asked the Buddha what would happen to him. The Buddha replied that Suppabuddha had been reborn in the Tāvatiṁsa heaven due to his attainment of Stream-Entry. The monks then asked why, if the Buddha knew he would die, he didn't prevent it more forcefully. The Buddha explained that there was no place where Suppabuddha could have hidden from death when his time had come. The Buddha spoke this verse, teaching that death is inescapable. He explained: 'Death cannot be avoided by going to the sky, diving into the ocean, or hiding in mountain caves. There is nowhere in this world where death cannot reach. This is why one must practice the Dhamma urgently and diligently, for we never know when death will come. Suppabuddha was fortunate - though he died, he died as a Stream-Winner, ensuring his ultimate liberation within seven more lifetimes at most. This is why attaining the Dhamma in this very life is so important - we cannot escape death, but we can attain liberation before death comes.'"

                        "content": "In the Jetavana monastery, a group of seventeen monks were cleaning and preparing a dwelling place with the intention of staying there during the rainy season retreat. They worked hard to make it suitable. While they were doing this, a group of six monks (the Chabbaggiya monks, who were notorious for their misconduct) arrived at the scene. Seeing the nicely prepared dwelling, these six monks said to the group of seventeen, 'We are your seniors in ordination. According to the rules, we have the right to this dwelling. You juniors should give way to us. This place is ours now.' The group of seventeen monks replied, 'Venerable brothers, we saw this place first and we have worked hard to prepare it. We should be allowed to stay here.' The six monks, being arrogant and disrespectful of proper conduct, became angry. They said, 'You dare to argue with your seniors? We will teach you a lesson!' They then violently assaulted the seventeen monks, beating them with their fists and whatever objects were at hand. The seventeen monks cried out in pain and fear for their lives. Other monks heard the commotion and came running. They found the younger monks injured and distressed, and the six monks standing over them defiantly. The matter was immediately reported to the Buddha. The Buddha summoned both groups of monks. He severely reprimanded the group of six, saying, 'This is a grave offense. You have violated the fundamental principles of the Dhamma. How can you, who have left the household life to follow the path of peace and liberation, engage in violence against your own brothers in the Sangha?' The Buddha then spoke this verse to all the monks assembled: 'All tremble at punishment; all fear death. Comparing oneself with others, one should neither kill nor cause another to kill.' The Buddha explained: 'Just as you fear being struck and fear death, so do all other beings. Put yourself in their place. How would you feel if someone beat you? How would you feel facing death? When you truly understand that others feel exactly as you do, how can you raise your hand against them?' Following this incident, the Buddha laid down a formal training rule (Vinaya rule) prohibiting monks from physically striking or assaulting others. This was one of many rules established to maintain peace and harmony in the monastic community."

                        "content": "After the Buddha had reprimanded the group of six monks and established the rule against physical violence, these same monks continued their troublesome behavior. Not long after the first incident, the same two groups of monks had another dispute over the same dwelling place. The group of six monks again tried to claim it as their right due to seniority. This time, however, because the Buddha had already laid down a rule prohibiting striking others, the six monks did not actually beat the seventeen monks. Instead, they raised their hands threateningly, made menacing gestures, and shouted intimidating words. They stood over the younger monks with clenched fists raised, as if about to strike. The seventeen monks, remembering the previous beating and seeing these threatening gestures, cried out in fear, believing they were about to be attacked again. Even though they were not actually struck this time, the terror they felt was real. Once again, other monks heard the disturbance and reported it to the Buddha. The Buddha summoned the group of six monks again. He said, 'Not only have you failed to learn from your previous misconduct, but you continue to terrorize your fellow monks. Do you not understand that threatening violence is itself a form of violence? Even if you do not actually strike them, you cause them to experience fear and suffering.' The Buddha then spoke this verse, emphasizing that life is dear to all beings. He explained: 'These seventeen monks love their lives just as you love yours. They fear harm and death just as you would. When you threaten them, even without touching them, you cause them genuine suffering because they fear for their lives. This too is wrong.' The Buddha then laid down another disciplinary rule forbidding monks from raising their hands or making threatening gestures toward others. The Buddha's teaching here shows that non-violence extends beyond refraining from actual physical harm - it includes avoiding threats, intimidation, and causing fear in others. The principle of empathy requires us to consider not just the physical effects of our actions but also the psychological and emotional suffering we might cause."

                        "content": "One day, the Buddha was walking on an alms-round in Sāvatthī when he came across a group of young boys playing near the roadside. The boys had found a snake and, afraid that it might bite them, they were beating it with sticks and stones. Some boys were laughing and treating it as sport, while others claimed they were just trying to kill it before it could harm anyone. The snake was writhing in pain, trying desperately to escape, but the boys surrounded it and continued their assault. The Buddha stopped and watched for a moment. Then he approached the boys and asked them, 'Why are you beating this snake?' The boys replied, 'Venerable Sir, we are afraid this snake might bite us or bite other people. Snakes are dangerous. We are killing it to protect ourselves and others. We are seeking safety and happiness by removing this danger.' The Buddha looked at them with compassion and said, 'Tell me, do you boys wish to be happy? Do you wish to live and enjoy life?' 'Yes, Venerable Sir,' they replied, 'of course we want to be happy and to live.' 'Do you fear pain and death?' the Buddha asked. 'Yes, Venerable Sir,' they answered, 'we fear pain and we fear death very much.' The Buddha then said, 'Look at this snake. It too wishes to be happy. It too wishes to live. It too fears pain and death, just as you do. Out of fear, you are beating this creature. But this snake has done nothing to you. It was simply resting here when you found it. You are causing it terrible suffering.' The Buddha continued, 'You say you are seeking happiness and safety for yourselves. But by harming this creature that also seeks happiness, you are actually creating the causes for your own future suffering. The karma of violence will follow you and prevent you from finding the very happiness you seek.' Then the Buddha spoke this verse: 'Whoever, seeking his own happiness, harms with violence other pleasure-loving beings, he does not find happiness hereafter.' The Buddha explained further: 'When you understand that all beings desire happiness just as you do, and fear suffering just as you do, you will naturally develop compassion. Instead of harming out of fear, you should practice kindness even toward creatures you fear. The snake wants only to live its life. If you leave it alone, it will go its own way and cause you no harm. But if you attack it, you may provoke it to defend itself, and you create negative karma that will prevent your future happiness.' The boys, hearing this teaching, felt remorse for their actions. They stopped beating the snake and let it escape. From that day forward, they were more careful not to harm living beings unnecessarily, even those they feared. The Buddha used this incident to teach an important lesson: that violence born of fear, or violence justified as seeking happiness and safety, still creates negative karma and leads to suffering. True happiness cannot be built on the suffering of other beings."

It teaches that one who seeks happiness but refrains from harming other beings who also seek happiness will find genuine happiness in future lives. The path to true happiness is through non-violence and compassion, not through harming others. This verse emphasizes that happiness and non-harming are aligned, not contradictory.

                        "content": "After the Buddha had taught the boys about the karmic consequences of violence, he elaborated on the positive path. He said to them, 'Listen well, young ones. Just as harming others in pursuit of your own happiness leads to future suffering, refraining from harm leads to future happiness.' The Buddha explained: 'If you see a snake and you fear it, you can simply move away. You can warn others to be careful. You can even gently guide it away from places where people walk. All of this can be done without violence and without harming the snake. When you seek your own safety and happiness in this way - without causing suffering to other beings - you create positive karma that will bring you happiness in this life and future lives.' The Buddha gave them practical advice: 'When you encounter creatures that frighten you, remember that they are also frightened - often more frightened of you than you are of them. Most creatures do not wish to harm humans; they only defend themselves when attacked. If you approach all beings with the understanding that they too seek happiness and fear suffering, you will naturally act with kindness and compassion. This kindness creates positive karma.' Then the Buddha spoke this verse: 'Whoever, seeking his own happiness, does not harm with violence other pleasure-loving beings, he finds happiness hereafter.' The boys took this teaching to heart. They not only stopped harming snakes and other creatures, but they actively began to practice kindness toward all living beings. They would carefully move insects out of harm's way, warn people about dangerous animals rather than killing them, and treat all creatures with respect. Their changed behavior became an example in their community. As these boys grew up practicing non-violence and compassion, they found that happiness came naturally to them. They had good relationships, felt at peace with themselves, and their lives were marked by good fortune. This was the immediate karmic result of their wholesome actions. The Buddha used these two verses (131 and 132) to teach a fundamental principle: our pursuit of happiness should never come at the expense of other beings' wellbeing. True, lasting happiness can only be found through the path of non-harming and compassion."

                        "content": "In Sāvatthī, there were several children who often played together near the marketplace. These children came from different families and had different temperaments. Among them were a few who had developed the habit of speaking roughly to others - using insulting language, mocking others, and shouting aggressively when they didn't get their way. One day, the group was playing a game when a dispute arose over the rules. One of the rough-spoken children began shouting insults at another child, calling him stupid and worthless. The insulted child, hurt and angry, shouted back even harsher insults. The first child escalated with cruder language. Soon both were screaming at each other with increasingly vicious words. Other children joined in, taking sides, and the verbal abuse spread through the whole group. Parents and neighbors heard the commotion. Some adults tried to intervene, but the children's anger had reached such a pitch that they ignored the adults. The verbal fight continued to escalate. Finally, one child, unable to contain his rage any longer, pushed another child violently. That child fell and hit his head on a stone, beginning to bleed. The pushed child's older brother, seeing his sibling injured, attacked the first child with his fists. Within moments, what had started as a game had become a violent brawl. Several children were injured, some seriously. Parents had to physically separate the fighting children. The incident created bad feelings between families in the neighborhood that lasted for a long time. Some monks who were on alms-round witnessed the aftermath of this incident - children crying with injuries, parents arguing, and the whole neighborhood in turmoil. When they returned to the monastery, they related what they had seen to the Buddha. The Buddha asked them how the fight had started. The monks explained that it had begun with harsh words between two children during a game, which then escalated into an exchange of insults, which finally erupted into physical violence. The Buddha nodded sadly and said, 'This is the natural progression of harsh speech. It leads to retaliation, escalation, and eventually physical harm.' Then the Buddha spoke this verse: 'Speak not harshly to anyone. Those thus spoken to will retort. Painful indeed is vindictive speech. Blows in exchange may bruise you.' The Buddha explained: 'When someone speaks harshly, the natural human reaction is to speak back even more harshly. This harsh speech itself is painful - it hurts to hear insulting or aggressive words, and it hurts to speak them, as it agitates the mind. But beyond this immediate pain, harsh speech often leads to physical violence. Words wound the heart, and wounded hearts often strike back with fists. Those children began with only words, but their harsh speech led inevitably to blows and bloodshed.' The Buddha continued: 'This is why the wise person guards their speech carefully. Even when provoked, even when others speak harshly to them, they respond with gentle words or remain silent. They understand that harsh words, like blows, have a boomerang effect - they come back to harm the speaker. If you speak harshly, you will be spoken to harshly. If harsh speech continues, violence often follows. But if you refuse to engage in harsh speech, you break the cycle before it escalates to violence.' The Buddha advised: 'When someone speaks roughly to you, pause before responding. Remember that harsh words lead to more harsh words, and harsh words lead to blows. Take a breath. Calm your mind. Then either respond gently and respectfully, or remain silent. In this way, you protect yourself and others from the escalating pain of verbal and physical violence.' The monks took this teaching back to their communities, and many people learned to be more careful with their speech, understanding that harsh words were the seeds of greater conflicts."

Immediately after the discourse, Santati approached the Buddha and requested ordination. The Buddha, seeing his readiness and sincerity, accepted him into the Sangha. Santati gave away all his wealth and possessions and became a monk. He practiced diligently and soon attained Arahantship, becoming completely free from all defilements. One day, not long after his attainment, Santati was on alms-round in the city. He happened to pass by his former mansion where he had lived in luxury. His former wife, who had not yet accepted his departure from household life, saw him walking past. She was still angry and resentful about his decision to become a monk, which she saw as abandoning her. Unable to contain her bitterness, she came out of the house and began to abuse Santati verbally in front of many people. She shouted insults at him, calling him ungrateful, irresponsible, and heartless. She accused him of caring nothing for her welfare after all the years they had spent together. She mocked his monk's robes and his choice to beg for food when he could have continued to live in wealth. The crowd gathered, expecting to see how the former minister would respond to this public humiliation. Some people felt uncomfortable hearing a woman abuse a monk in this way. Others waited to see if Santati would defend himself or respond to her accusations. But Venerable Santati stood there in complete silence, his face calm and peaceful, showing no sign of anger, hurt, or defensive reaction. He simply maintained his composure, like a cracked gong that makes no sound when struck. His mind remained equanimous, unmoved by the harsh words. When the woman finally exhausted her anger and fell silent, Santati simply moved on with his alms-round, continuing peacefully as if nothing had happened. The crowd was astonished. Many people were deeply impressed by his perfect self-control and inner peace. Some of the witnesses went to the Buddha and described what they had seen. They asked, 'How could Venerable Santati remain so completely unmoved by such harsh public abuse? Most people would have been deeply hurt or angry. But he showed not the slightest disturbance. How is this possible?' The Buddha smiled and said, 'Santati has attained Arahantship. He has completely eliminated anger, pride, and all reactive patterns from his mind. When harsh words are spoken to him, there is no anger to arise. When he is insulted, there is no wounded pride to defend. His mind is like a cracked gong that cannot resonate - when struck with harsh words, it makes no sound of retaliation or disturbance.' Then the Buddha spoke this verse: 'If, like a cracked gong, you silence yourself, you have already attained Nibbāna; in you no contention is found.' The Buddha explained further: 'A normal person, when criticized or insulted, immediately feels anger arise. The mind resonates with the harsh words, generating hostile thoughts and often harsh words in return. This reaction is automatic and natural for the unenlightened. But one who has attained Nibbāna has eliminated the conditions for such reactions. When harsh words come, they find nothing to disturb, like a sound wave hitting a cracked gong that cannot vibrate. This perfect non-reaction is a sign of having attained the highest peace. It is not suppression of anger - it is the complete absence of anger. It is not forced silence - it is natural peace.' The Buddha continued: 'All of you should take Venerable Santati as an example. Train yourselves not to react with hostility when provoked. When someone speaks harshly to you, pause before responding. Watch your mind. Notice the tendency to react with anger or defensive words. Instead of following that tendency, simply remain silent, calm, and peaceful. As you practice this more and more, your reactions will become less intense, until eventually, like an Arahant, you can remain perfectly peaceful no matter what others say or do. This is true spiritual accomplishment.'"

                        "content": "In Sāvatthī, there was a group of women who were close friends. They had known each other since childhood and had grown up together. As young girls, they had played together, laughed together, and shared their dreams of the future. As they grew into young women, they celebrated together, supporting each other through life's joys and sorrows. They all married around the same time and started families together. Their children played together just as they had. Life seemed happy and stable. Years passed, and the women continued to meet regularly, sharing meals and stories. But gradually, they began to notice changes. Gray hairs appeared. Their skin lost its youthful glow. They moved more slowly. Simple tasks that once were effortless now required more effort. One by one, their parents died. Then their husbands began to age visibly as well. Some became ill. One day, one of the women - who had been the most vibrant and cheerful of the group - fell seriously ill and died suddenly. The remaining friends were shocked and grieved deeply. They had lost others before, but this was one of their own circle, someone their own age. Not long after, another of the group passed away. Then another. The survivors began to realize with growing horror that they too were approaching the end. Old age and death, which had once seemed distant concerns, were now their constant reality. The remaining women, now elderly and few in number, went together to see the Buddha. They told him their story - how they had been young together, how life had seemed full of promise, how they had expected to grow old peacefully. But instead, they had watched their group diminish, one friend after another taken by death. Now they were old themselves and frightened. One of the women asked the Buddha, 'Venerable Sir, when we were young, we never thought about death. It seemed so far away. We were busy with our families, our homes, our daily activities. We thought we had time. But now death has claimed most of our friends, and we see that it is coming for us too. How did this happen? Why were we not more aware?' The Buddha looked at them with compassion and said, 'This is the way of all conditioned existence. From the moment we are born, old age and death drive us forward like a cowherd drives cattle with his staff. We have no choice in this. We cannot stop aging. We cannot avoid death. These forces push us relentlessly forward whether we wish it or not.' Then the Buddha spoke this verse: 'Just as a cowherd drives the cattle to pasture with a staff, so do old age and death drive the life of beings.' The Buddha explained: 'Think of cattle being driven to pasture. The cowherd walks behind them with his staff, and they must go where he directs. If they stop or try to turn back, he prods them forward with his staff. They have no choice but to move in the direction he drives them. In exactly the same way, all beings are driven by old age and death. From the moment of birth, we are being pushed toward old age. From the moment we begin to age, we are being pushed toward death. We cannot stop. We cannot turn back. We cannot resist these forces. Old age and death prod us constantly forward like that cowherd's staff.' The Buddha continued: 'You ask why you were not more aware when you were young. The truth is that old age and death were driving you even then, but you did not notice because you were looking in other directions. You were focused on youth, beauty, pleasure, family, and worldly affairs. These things distracted you from seeing the relentless approach of old age and death. But they were there all along, pushing you forward year by year, day by day, moment by moment.' The women asked, 'What should we have done differently? What should we do now?' The Buddha replied, 'When you are young and strong, that is the time to practice the Dhamma diligently. That is when you have the energy and capability to make spiritual progress. Do not wait until old age and death are obviously near. Start practicing immediately, because old age and death are already driving you forward whether you see them or not.' The Buddha added, 'But it is never too late to begin. Even now, in your old age, you can practice. The time left to you is uncertain, but whatever time you have, use it wisely. Practice mindfulness. Contemplate impermanence. Let go of attachment. Even if death comes tomorrow, you can spend today creating merit and purifying your mind. This is the most important use of whatever life remains.' The women took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, and devoted their remaining years to practice. Though they had little time left, they practiced with great urgency and mindfulness, understanding that old age and death were driving them forward and that every moment was precious. The Buddha used this story to teach all beings: Do not delay in spiritual practice. Do not think you have unlimited time. Old age and death are driving you forward right now, in this very moment. Practice now, while you still can."

                        "content": "In a forest near Sāvatthī, there lived a peta (hungry ghost) who had been reborn in that miserable state as a result of evil karma from a previous life. This particular peta had an unusual and horrifying appearance - his body resembled a crocodile, covered in tough, scaly skin. But unlike a normal crocodile that lives in water, this peta was consumed by flames. Fire constantly burned his body from within, causing him unbearable agony. He could find no relief, no water to cool his burning form, no rest from the torment. The peta wandered through the forest, groaning in pain, occasionally visible to people with refined spiritual faculties. One day, the Elder Moggallāna, who possessed great psychic powers and could see beings in various realms, was walking through the forest on his alms-round. He perceived this crocodile-peta suffering in flames and felt great compassion. Having the ability to communicate with beings in other realms, he stopped and asked the peta, 'Friend, what evil deed did you commit in your past life that has resulted in this terrible suffering? Why do you appear as a crocodile, and why are you being burned by fire?' The peta, grateful for this opportunity to tell his story, replied with great anguish: 'Venerable Sir, in my previous life, I was a human being. I lived near a river where many fish and crocodiles could be found. I was a fisherman by trade, but I was particularly cruel in my methods. I did not simply catch fish to sell or eat. I took pleasure in causing suffering. When I caught fish, I would sometimes torture them for my amusement before killing them. I would pull out their scales one by one while they were still alive, watching them writhe in pain. Sometimes I would leave them to die slowly in the sun, gasping for water. But my worst deed involved crocodiles. One day, I managed to trap a young crocodile in my net. Instead of killing it quickly or releasing it, I decided to burn it alive. I poured oil over the creature and set it on fire, watching with cruel satisfaction as it thrashed and struggled in the flames until it died. I felt no remorse for this action. I thought it was just an animal and that what I did to it didn't matter. I believed I would face no consequences. I was a fool, lacking wisdom. I did not understand the law of karma - that every action, good or bad, produces corresponding results. I did not realize that I was creating the causes for my own future suffering. I committed these evil deeds without understanding their nature or their consequences.' The peta continued, now weeping in anguish: 'After I died, I was immediately reborn in this wretched state. Because I had burned that crocodile alive, I now have the form of a crocodile that is constantly burned by flames. Because I tortured fish and took pleasure in their suffering, I now experience unbearable agony myself. This torture has continued for a very long time, and I do not know when it will end. Every moment is excruciating. I am burned continuously by fire from within, and there is no escape, no relief, no moment of peace. I am tormented by my own deeds, suffering the exact consequences of the suffering I inflicted on others. Now, too late, I understand the law of karma. Now, too late, I wish I had been wise enough to avoid evil actions. But when I was alive, I was a fool. I did not realize what I was doing to myself.' Elder Moggallāna, deeply moved by this account, returned to the monastery and related the peta's story to the other monks. The monks were shocked and asked the Buddha about it. The Buddha confirmed that what Elder Moggallāna had witnessed was true. The Buddha then spoke this verse: 'When the fool commits evil deeds, he does not realize their nature. The witless person is tormented by his own deeds, like one burnt by fire.' The Buddha explained further: 'This peta was indeed a fool when he was alive. He committed terrible acts of cruelty, believing there would be no consequences. He lacked the wisdom to understand that harming other beings creates the causes for one's own suffering. He did not realize the nature of his evil actions - that they were planting seeds of future torment. Now he suffers intensely, burned by fire just as he burned that crocodile, tormented just as he tormented those fish. His suffering is self-created, the direct result of his own evil karma. This is what happens to those who commit evil in ignorance, without understanding the law of cause and effect.' The Buddha used this story to teach an important lesson about the relationship between ignorance, evil actions, and suffering. He emphasized that ignorance of karmic law does not protect one from its consequences. Just as someone who touches fire gets burned whether they understand the nature of fire or not, someone who commits evil will suffer the consequences whether they understand karma or not. The Buddha concluded: 'This is why wisdom is so essential. The wise person understands the nature of actions and their consequences. Understanding this, they carefully avoid all evil and cultivate only good. The fool, lacking this understanding, commits evil freely, not realizing they are creating their own future hell. Do not be like this fool. Develop wisdom. Understand the law of karma. Avoid all evil, knowing that every harmful action you commit is like grasping fire - it will surely burn you.'"
